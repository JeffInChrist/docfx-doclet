A test case defines the fixture to run multiple tests. To define a test case<br/>
<ol>
  <li>implement a subclass of <code>TestCase</code></li>
  <li>define instance variables that store the state of the fixture</li>
  <li>initialize the fixture state by overriding {@link #setUp()}</li>
  <li>clean-up after a test by overriding {@link #tearDown()}.</li>
</ol>
Each test runs in its own fixture so there
can be no side effects among test runs.
Here is an example:
<pre>
public class MathTest extends TestCase {
   protected double fValue1;
   protected double fValue2;

   protected void setUp() {
      fValue1= 2.0;
      fValue2= 3.0;
   }
}
</pre>

For each test implement a method which interacts
with the fixture. Verify the expected results with assertions specified
by calling {@link junit.framework.Assert#assertTrue(String, boolean)} with a boolean.
<pre>
   public void testAdd() {
      double result= fValue1 + fValue2;
      assertTrue(result == 5.0);
   }
</pre>

Once the methods are defined you can run them. The framework supports
both a static type safe and more dynamic way to run a test.
In the static way you override the runTest method and define the method to
be invoked. A convenient way to do so is with an anonymous inner class.
<pre>
TestCase test= new MathTest("add") {
   public void runTest() {
      testAdd();
   }
};
test.run();
</pre>
The dynamic way uses reflection to implement {@link #runTest()}. It dynamically finds
and invokes a method.
In this case the name of the test case has to correspond to the test method
to be run.
<pre>
TestCase test= new MathTest("testAdd");
test.run();
</pre>

The tests to be run can be collected into a TestSuite. JUnit provides
different <i>test runners</i> which can run a test suite and collect the results.
A test runner either expects a static method <code>suite</code> as the entry
point to get a test to run or it will extract the suite automatically.
<pre>
public static Test suite() {
   suite.addTest(new MathTest("testAdd"));
   suite.addTest(new MathTest("testDivideByZero"));
   return suite;
}
</pre>
